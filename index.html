      <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>
        I am graduating the University of Iowa in May 2025, with a B.B.A. in
        Business Analytics and Information Systems. A few things about me is
        that I love building and solving things. I have built a computer from
        scratch and love to figure out why something happens, whether this be a
        client need, a data problem, or a business problem. I love finding the
        solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        The time outside of studying and schoolwork is that I am kitchen manager
        in a local Iowa City BBQ resturant, and currently getting involved in
        TheBigShouldersFund. Which helps funding to Catholic schools so kids can
        have access to education and higher education (college, trades, etc.)
